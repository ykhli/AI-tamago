## Quickstart

### 1. Fork and Clone repo

Fork the repo to your Github account, then run the following command to clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:[YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT_NAME]/AI-tamago.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```
cd ai-tamago
npm run dev
```

All client side tamagotchi code is in Tamagotchi.tsx

### 3. Install Ollama
Instructions are [here](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama#macos).

### 4. Run Supabase locally
1. Install Supabase CLI

```
brew install supabase/tap/supabase
```

2. Start Supabase

Make sure you are under `/ai-tamago` directory and run:

```
supabase start
```

Tips: To run migrations or reset database -- seed.sql and migrations will run
`supabase db reset`

### 5. Fill in secrets

```
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then get `SUPABASE_PRIVATE_KEY` by running

```
supabase status
```

Copy `service_role key` and save it as `SUPABASE_PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env.local`

### 6. Set up Inngest
`npx inngest-cli@latest dev`

Make sure your app is up and running -- Inngest functions (which are used to drive game state) should register automatically. 

### 7. Run app locally

Now you are ready to test out the app locally! To do this, simply run `npm run dev` under the project root and visit `http://localhost:3000`.
